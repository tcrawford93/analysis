# New York Service Requests

The data was gathered from public sources. The data can be accessed here: https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-
Requests-from-2010-toPresent/erm2-nwe9

The aim of the analysis was to act as if I am advising Ney York decision makers into how to combat and address the service requests that are coming in across the city of New York so that they can be more effective in dealing with these.

I have compiled some analysis into the types of service requests that are being generated on a year on year basis. What agencies are receiving the most service calls. What times of the day these service requests are being generated to highlight when operators should be stationed to react to these calls and some of the highest generating boroughs and zip codes within these boroughs to help services better resource different areas of their work force.
